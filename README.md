# How to use
Clone, conquer, and make things happen! Get your hands on the repository like a pro,
```console
git clone https://github.com/siesing/fedora-post-install.git
```
then sprinkle some magic dust on the `fedora-post-install.sh` file with a little command called `chmod +x`.

```console
chmod +x fedora-post-install.sh
```

Now give that script a high-five and hit the runway by running it like there's no tomorrow.
```console
./fedora-post-install.sh
```

This script performs a symphony of digital wondersâ€”a thrilling ride as it optimizes the speed of the package manager, updates Fedora, installs essential software, bids farewell to the unnecessary software, sets up the Flathub repository, installs must-have Flatpaks, and adds a touch of enchantment to the Terminal with the mesmerizing neofetch.
